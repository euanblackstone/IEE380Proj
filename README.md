# IEE380 Project
A benchmark of different sorting algorithms written in Python.

# Objective
This is a project I did for my Probability and Statistics class. The goal of the project was to gain experience in gathering and analyzing data, and generating a technical report from the data. The software implements 25 sorting algorithms and collects two sets of data from them: how many times each algorithm writes to an array, and how fast each algorithm accomplishes its task. To see the complete statistical analysis, please read the full technical report in the main repository.
