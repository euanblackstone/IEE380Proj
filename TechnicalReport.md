# Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## **Objectives** 
Students rarely receive experience in the collection and analysis of data. Usually, the data used for analysis is given to the student. This project is meant to reverse that by having students collect and analyze their own data. Thus, the objective of this project is to provide students with data collection experience that is lacking in their usual coursework. Through this project, students will learn to use statistical software (such as Minitab, Excel, etc.) and write technical reports for industry use.

## **Data Description**
In computer science, one of the venerable challenges is sorting; Sorting is taking a set of data and rearranging it in order. For example, a set of numbers would be rearranged in increasing order. Innumerable solutions have been developed for sorting. In this technical report, 25 different sorting algorithms are benchmarked to determine how they perform on the same data set of 20,000 randomized integers from 0 to 100,000. The sorting algorithms were implemented using the Python programming language and executed with this collection of numbers.

The discrete data collected indexes every time a sorting algorithm writes to an array in memory. An array is a collection of multiple items (numbers, in this case), and the program tallies each time a sorting algorithm changes a value in the main array or an auxiliary array. 25 different sorting algorithms produced 25 pieces of discrete data detailing how many times each algorithm wrote to an array.

The continuous data were collected by timing each algorithm. For all 25 sorting algorithms, the algorithms were tasked with sorting the randomized list of numbers and the execution was timed. This produced 25 different times showing how fast each algorithm accomplished the task.

## **Discussion**
The histogram of the discrete data set contains a prominent right skew. Most of the sorting algorithms were able to accomplish the task using less than 60 million writes to arrays. The skewed discrete distribution could mean that it is a Poisson distribution â€“ Poisson distributions can have a skew.

The histogram of the continuous data (much like the discrete data) has a prominent right skew. Most sorting algorithms can sort the data in under nine seconds. This makes sense as the optimization of sorting algorithms over time has allowed them to sort enormous data sets in relatively little time. The skewed continuous distribution could indicate that the distribution is an exponential probability density function. Exponential distributions are usually skewed harshly to one side, resembling the distribution of sort time.
